# CHANGELOG

## v0.4 (future)

### Features

- Added support for the `SUPD_FILE` environment variable for controlling where the updates file is located.

## v0.3 (2020-06-13)

### Features

- The `help` command is now empowered to show usage instructions for other sub-commands. You may now run `supd help edit` to see detailed usage instructions for the `supd edit` command. You can even run `supd help help`, though it's a bit redundant.

### Removals

- Removed the `-h` flag from the root command to show help. We will only support using the `supd help` command to view the help.

## v0.2 (2020-06-13)

### Features

- Added an `edit` command which opens the updates file in `$EDITOR`
